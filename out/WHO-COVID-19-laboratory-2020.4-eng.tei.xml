<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Several coronaviruses can infect humans, the globally endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 that tend to cause mild respiratory disease, and the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that have a higher case fatality rate. In December 2019, a cluster of patients with a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Initially tentatively named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the virus has now been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. This virus can cause the disease named coronavirus disease 2019 . WHO refers to the virus as COVID-19 virus in its current documentation.</p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide interim guidance to laboratories and stakeholders involved in COVID-19 virus laboratory testing of patients.</p><p>Existing WHO documents have been consulted for drafting this interim guidance, including the interim guidance on laboratory testing for MERS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>. Information on human infection with the COVID-19 virus is evolving and WHO continues to monitor developments and revise recommendations as necessary. Feedback is welcome and can be sent to WHElab@who.int.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Laboratory testing guiding principles for patients who meet the suspect case definition</head><p>The decision to test should be based on clinical and epidemiological factors and linked to an assessment of the likelihood of infection. PCR testing of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic contacts can be considered in the assessment of individuals who have had contact with a COVID-19 case. Screening protocols should be adapted to the local situation. The case definitions are being regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes available. For the WHO suspect case definition see: Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Rapid collection and testing of appropriate specimens from patients meeting the suspect case definition for COVID-19 is a priority for clinical management and outbreak control and should be guided by a laboratory expert. Suspect cases should be screened for the virus with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as RT-PCR.</p><p>If testing for COVID- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref> is not yet available nationally, specimens should be referred. A list of WHO reference laboratories providing confirmatory testing for COVID-19 and shipment instructions are available in Section 4 of the following webpage: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratoryguidance.</p><p>If case management requires, patients should be tested for other respiratory pathogens using routine laboratory procedures, as recommended in local management guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Additional testing should not delay testing for COVID-19. As co-infections can occur, all patients that meet the suspect case definition should be tested for COVID-19 virus regardless of whether another respiratory pathogen is found.</p><p>Laboratory testing for coronavirus disease 2019  in suspected human cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim guidance 2 March 2020</head><p>In an early study in Wuhan, the mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 5.2 days among 425 cases, though it varies widely between individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13)</ref>. Virus shedding patterns are not yet well understood and further investigations are needed to better understand the timing, compartmentalization and quantity of viral shedding to inform optimal specimen collection. Though respiratory samples have the greatest yield, the virus can be detected in other specimens, including stool and blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16)</ref>. Local guidelines should be followed regarding patient or guardian's informed consent for specimen collection, testing and potentially future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Specimen collection and shipment</head><p>Safety procedures during specimen collection Ensure that adequate SOPs are in use and that staff are trained for appropriate specimen collection, storage, packaging and transport. All specimens collected for laboratory investigations should be regarded as potentially infectious.</p><p>Ensure that health care workers who collect specimens adhere rigorously to infection prevention and control guidelines. Specific WHO interim guidance has been published: "Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected, interim guidance, January 2020" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(17)</ref> and "WHO interim guidance for laboratory biosafety related to 2019-nCoV" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(18)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specimens to be collected</head><p>At minimum, respiratory material should be collected:</p><p>upper respiratory specimens: nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or wash in ambulatory patients and/or lower respiratory specimens: sputum (if produced) and/or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with more severe respiratory disease. (Note high risk of aerosolization; adhere strictly to infection prevention and control procedures).</p><p>Additional clinical specimens may be collected as COVID-19 virus has been detected in blood and stool, as had the coronaviruses responsible for SARS and MERS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(21)</ref>. The duration and frequency of shedding of COVID-19 virus in stool and potentially in urine is unknown. In case of patients who are deceased, consider autopsy material including lung tissue. In surviving patients, paired serum (acute and convalescent) can be useful to retrospectively define cases as serological assays become available.</p><p>Further recommendations on materials to collect, including the testing of asymptomatic individuals, can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Packaging and shipment of clinical specimens</head><p>Specimens for virus detection should reach the laboratory as soon as possible after collection. Correct handling of specimens during transportation is essential. Specimens which can be delivered promptly to the laboratory can be stored and shipped at 2-8°C. When there is likely to be a delay in specimens reaching the laboratory, the use of viral transport medium is strongly recommended. Specimens may be frozen to -20°C or ideally -70°C and shipped on dry ice if further delays are expected (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>). It is important to avoid repeated freezing and thawing of specimens.</p><p>Transport of specimens within national borders should comply with applicable national regulations. International transport of potentially COVID-19 virus containing samples should follow the UN Model Regulations, and any other applicable regulations depending on the mode of transport being used. More information may be found in the "WHO Guidance on regulations for the Transport of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 1. Biosafety practices in the laboratory</head><p>Testing on clinical specimens from patients meeting the suspect case definition should be performed in appropriately equipped laboratories by staff trained in the relevant technical and safety procedures. National guidelines on laboratory biosafety should be followed in all circumstances. There is still limited information on the risk posed by COVID-19, but all procedures should be undertaken based on a risk assessment. Specimen handling for molecular testing would require BSL-2 or equivalent facilities. Attempts to culture the virus require BSL-3 facilities at minimum.</p><p>For more information related to COVID-19 risk assessment, see specific interim guidance document: 'WHO interim guidance for laboratory biosafety related to 2019-nCoV' <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(18)</ref>. Samples that are potentially infectious materials (PIM) for polio need to be handled and stored as described in WHO document "Guidance to minimize risks for facilities collecting, handling or storing materials potentially infectious for polioviruses (PIM Guidance)" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(23)</ref>. For general laboratory biosafety guidelines, see the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 3rd edition before the 4th edition is released.</p><p>Infectious Substances 2019-2020" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(22)</ref> and "WHO interim guidance for laboratory biosafety related to 2019-nCoV" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(18)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ensure good communication with the laboratory and provide needed information</head><p>Alerting the laboratory before sending specimens encourages proper and timely processing of samples and timely reporting. Specimens should be correctly labelled and accompanied by a diagnostic request form (template provided in Annex I). When there are discordant results, the patient should be resampled and, if appropriate, sequencing of the virus from the original specimen or of an amplicon generated from an appropriate NAAT assay, different from the NAAT assay initially used, should be obtained to provide a reliable test result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Laboratory testing for COVID-19 virus</head><p>Laboratories are urged to seek confirmation of any surprising results in an international reference laboratory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory confirmed case by NAAT in areas with established COVID-19 virus circulation</head><p>In areas where COVID-19 virus is widely spread a simpler algorithm might be adopted in which for example screening by rRT-PCR of a single discriminatory target is considered sufficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>One or more negative results do not rule out the possibility of COVID-19 virus infection. A number of factors could lead to a negative result in an infected individual, including:</head><p>poor quality of the specimen, containing little patient material (as a control, consider determining whether there is adequate human DNA in the sample by including a human target in the PCR testing) -the specimen was collected late or very early in the infection the specimen was not handled and shipped appropriately technical reasons inherent in the test, e.g. virus mutation or PCR inhibition.</p><p>If a negative result is obtained from a patient with a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 virus infection, particularly when only upper respiratory tract specimens were collected, additional specimens, including from the lower respiratory tract if possible, should be collected and tested.</p><p>Each NAAT run should include both external and internal controls, and laboratories are encouraged to participate in external quality assessment schemes when they become available. It is also recommended to laboratories who order their own primers and probes to perform entry testing/validation on functionality and potential contaminants. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viral sequencing</head><p>In addition to providing confirmation of the presence of the virus, regular sequencing of a percentage of specimens from clinical cases can be useful to monitor for viral genome mutations that might affect the performance of medical countermeasures, including diagnostic tests. Virus whole genome sequencing can also inform molecular epidemiology studies. Many publicaccess databases for deposition of genetic sequence data are available, including GISAID, which is intended to protect the rights of the submitting party (27).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viral culture</head><p>Virus isolation is not recommended as a routine diagnostic procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Reporting of cases and test results</head><p>Laboratories should follow national reporting requirements. In general, all test results, positive or negative, should be immediately reported to national authorities. States Parties to the IHR are reminded of their obligations to share with WHO relevant public health information for events for which they notified WHO, using the decision instrument in Annex 1 of the IHR (2005) (28).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Research toward improved detection of COVID-19 virus</head><p>Many aspects of the virus and disease are still not understood. A better understanding will be needed to provide improved guidance. For example:  Baseline serum taken as early as possible within incubation period of contact and convalescent serum taken 2-4 weeks after last contact (optimal timing for convalescent sample needs to be established). Aside from specific collection materials indicated in the table also assure other materials and equipment are available: e.g. transport containers and specimen collection bags and packaging, coolers and cold packs or dry ice, sterile blood-drawing equipment (e.g. needles, syringes and tubes), labels and permanent markers, PPE, materials for decontamination of surfaces etc. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3" validated="false"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Specimens to be collected from symptomatic patients and contactsWithin incubation period of last documented contact.</figDesc><table>Test
